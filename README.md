# Power-BI-Projects
Collection of Power BI dashboards and analytics projects focused on business and sales insights.

# 1 . Tata Cars Sales Dashboard
## 📊 Overview
This project analyzes Tata Motors car sales data (2000–2025) for both new and used vehicles using Power BI. The aim is to understand sales trends, best-selling models, fuel preferences, body type performance, transmission usage, EV growth, and state-wise sales insights.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify best-selling models (overall & by body type)
- Compare new vs used car sales
- Analyze demand across fuel types (Petrol, Diesel, CNG, Electric, Hybrid)
- Study EV penetration
- Evaluate transmission preferences
- Find top-performing states
- Highlight mileage leaders
- Perform data cleaning & correction for fuel types and body types

## 🧹 Data Preparation
Raw dataset had multiple inconsistencies:
- Incorrect fuel type tagging (some Petrol/Diesel cars marked as EV)
- Body type mismatches
- Duplicate model naming formats

## ✅ Corrections
- Created Corrected Fuel Type column:
- Cars containing “EV” in model → marked Electric
- Incorrect Electric entries → reverted to Petrol
- Diesel & CNG preserved
- Hybrid & Petrol+CNG retained
- Created Corrected Body Type
- Standardized model names
- Filtered new vs used using owner count
